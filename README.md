# Car Inventory Management System

This is my first attempt at a car inventory management system written in C. During the development of this project, I focused on understanding and implementing key concepts such as:

- **Structs**: To model car inventory and sales data.
- **File Persistence**: Saving and loading data to maintain car inventory and sales records across the program's execution.
- **Sorting and Searching**: Implemented basic sorting algorithms and search functionality for managing the inventory.

The project allowed me to learn how to structure code, manage data using structs, and persist that data to files. It also helped me understand the importance of clean, maintainable code as I worked on refactoring and improving the design.

## Features

- Add new cars to the inventory
- Track car sales and update inventory
- View car inventory and search by various attributes like model, year, etc.
- Persist car data to a file

## Technology Used

- **C Programming Language**: The project is written entirely in C, using basic file I/O, structs, and functions.
- **Standard Library Functions**: Used standard C libraries for sorting, input and output, and string manipulation.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to refactor the code for better organization by splitting it into separate files and adding more documentation, including unit testing.

Ho## How to Run

1. Compile the program:  
   `gcc -o Car-program main.c`

2. Run the program:  
   `./Car-program`
